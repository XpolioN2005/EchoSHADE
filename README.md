### 🧠 Dev Note
Unfortunately, I couldn’t finish the game in time due to some personal issues.  
As a result, a few features were cut, and the main music is not yet implemented.

### 🕹️ About the Game
You’re being hunted by your own reflection — a **doppelgänger** that mirrors your every move.  
Lost in a shifting maze of shadows, your only hope is to keep moving.

> Step too far into the dark… and it will find you.

Navigate the labyrinth and outsmart the echo that **learns from your every move**.

A short, atmospheric survival game about **paranoia and reflection**.

### 🎮 How to Play
