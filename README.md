Echoshade

[Spooky JAM 2D 2025 Submission]

DEV NOTE: Unfortunately, I couldn’t finish the game in time due to some personal issues. As a result, a few features were cut, and the main music is not yet implemented.

You’re being hunted by your own reflection — a doppelgänger that mirrors your every move. Lost in a shifting maze of shadows, your only hope is to keep moving.

Step too far into the dark… and it will find you.

Navigate the labyrinth and outsmart the echo that learns from your every move.

🕹️ How to Play
Use Arrow Keys to move

Mirrors spawn your echo

Avoid your echo and survive

A short, atmospheric survival game about paranoia and reflection.
